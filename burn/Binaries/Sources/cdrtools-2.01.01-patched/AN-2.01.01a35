Please have a look at the German open Source Center BerliOS at www.berlios.de
BerliOS will continue to support free hosting of cryptography projects even
when US laws change and don't allow to host cryptography projects in the USA.
Also look at sourcewell.berlios.de, the first Open Source announcement service
that itself is implemented as Open Source project.

***************** Important news ****************************

For the 'Slottable Source Plugin Module' SSPM Features read README.SSPM

***************** Please Test *********************************

NEW features of cdrtools-2.01.01a35:

*******
NOTE: this is _not_ a release that starts a new aplha/beta series of
	distibutions. The only reason is to add certain new CD/DVD features
	that are important.

	So _please_ do not send any patches except when you like to fix
	extreme bugs. I am currently mainly working on stable incremental
	restore featurs for star-1.5-final.
	Once star-1.5-final is out, cdrtools will start a new developent cycle.
*******


All:

Libschily:

-	Fixed a bug in checkerr.c that was caused by the fact that errflags() 
	did try to modify it's string argument.


Libparanoia (Ported/enhanced by Jörg Schilling, originated by Monty xiphmont@mit.edu):

-	Set a useful default for the dynamic sector overlap start sector
	in case that the dynamic sector overlap limits are manually changed

Libedc (Optimized by Jörg Schilling, originated by Heiko Eißfeldt heiko@hexco.de):

Libfind:

Libfile:

Libhfs_iso:

Libsiconv:

Libscg:

Rscsi:

Cdrecord:

-	Better code structure for dvd/bd driver recognition.


Cdda2wav (Maintained/enhanced by Jörg Schilling, originated by Heiko Eißfeldt heiko@hexco.de):

-	New option start-sector=sector allows to set an absolute sector number 
	where to start audio extraction.

	This option has been added as a first step to allow to write a
	wrapper for cdda2wav to create a "GStreamer plugin". This helps
	to:

	-	avoid license problems in libcdio

	-	allows to call a privileged programs like cdda2wav from a GUI
		to grant full audio extraction quality that needs generic SCSI
		commands.

-	Cstyle indentation changes

-	Man page now includes some forgotten options

-	Man page now describes the paraopts= sub option list

-	Man page now describes the statistic output from the paranoia code

Scgcheck:

Scgskeleton:

Btcflash:

Mkisofs (Maintained/enhanced by Jörg Schilling since 1997, originated by Eric Youngdale):

	HELIOS TODO:

	-	Add the HELIOS UNICODE mapping code. This needs to be done 
		at UCS-2 level for Joliet and UDF (instead of UTF-8) and only
		for Rock Ridge (in case of a UTF-8 based target locale) using
		UTF-8 based translations.

	-	Make the Apple extensions work again with "mkisofs -find"

TODO:
	-	Support correct inode numbers for UDF hardlinks

	-	Support sockets, pipes, char/blk-dev specials with UDF

	-	read Joliet filenames with multi-session if no TRANS.TBL
		or RR is present. I am looking for a volunteer for this task!

		Note that this can never be 100% correct as there is no relation
		between the names on the master (UNIX) filesystem, the ISO-9660
		names and the Joliet names. Only the Rock Ridge names are
		untranslated with respect to the original files on the
		master (UNIX) filesystem.

	-	add libecc/edc for CDI and similar.


CYGWIN NT-4.0 NOTES:

To compile on Cygwin32, get Cygwin and install it.
For more information read README.win32

The files are located on:

ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha ...

NOTE:	These tar archives are 100% POSIX compatible. GNU tar may get some
	minor trouble. If you like a 100% POSIX compliant tar, get star from
	ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/star/

WARNING: Do not use 'winzip' to extract the tar file!
	Winzip cannot extract symbolic links correctly.
