dvda-author  version 08.12-dev (December 2008)
==============================


1. DESCRIPTION
--------------


dvda-author creates high-definition DVD-Audio disc structures from either WAV, 
FLAC/Ogg FLAC, or SoX-14.1-supported audio formats (.au, .aiff, .gsm, etc.)

This version supports multichannel audio up to 5.1.

Switch -x enables extraction of audio content from DVD-Audio structures into .wav files.

It can also create "hybrid" or "universal" DVD-Audio/Video disc structures, 
which contain both DVD-Audio and DVD-Video zones. 

A new navigation feature makes it possible to start playing a video
title from within audio zone or an audio title from within video zone.

fixwav is an companion tool installed with dvda-author as an autonomous executable.
See fixwav/README for instructions.

5. INSTALLATION 
---------------

See file INSTALL included in this distribution.
On *nix platforms, the GNU build system will automatically link to existing libFLAC
libraries, checking for the appropriate version (1.2.1 and later).
If your installed library is not compatible, or on Windows platforms, libFLAC will be
rebuilt from source code in directory libFLAC/

If you do not use the GNU build system, check that the configuration file dvda-author.conf
is in the same directory as the main executable (see INSTALL for other options).
By default, binaries will install under /usr/bin.

This version will use either libiberty.a if already installed on your platform
or source code for a few GNU libc functions located in glibc/ The list of functions
used depends on platforms.
