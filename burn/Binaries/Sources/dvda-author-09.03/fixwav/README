1. DESCRIPTION
==============

fixwav repairs Microsoft .wav soundfiles and creates
canonical wav headers.
An automatic repair mode is proposed, which should avoid user input in 
most cases.

See man (1) page on *nix platforms or fixwav.html for help on usage.


2. BUILDING
===========

A precompiled Windows executable is shipped with this installer.
The binary is in directory CB_project/fixwav/bin

For source code packages (.tar.gz or .tar.bz2) no binary is shipped
but two building modes are proposed:

A) Code::Blocks build

Open the Code::Blocks workspace file in CB_project. You will need 
Code::Blocks, which is available at http://www.codeblocks.org

Click on Build > Workspace and upon completion fetch the binary 
in CB_project/fixwav/bin

B) GNU install procedure

See file INSTALL. Basically:

a) extract package (tar -xjvf under Unix or Cywin for Windows platforms).
b) cd into new directory
c) in a bash shell enter: ./configure.
d) once configured, compile with gcc version 4.2 (and up), enter: make
e) once compiled install under /usr/bin by typing: make install

Other compiler can be used (see INSTALL file for details).
