fixwav
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fixwav [OPTIONS] WAV files
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBfixwav\fR tests compliance of WAV file headers to standard.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.PP
\fB\-q\fR|\-\-quiet
.IP
silent mode: no dialog or screen output. Options \fB\-b\fR, \fB\-s\fR, \fB\-c\fR must be set.
Warning: write operations will be enabled. \fB\-q\fR should preferably be used first.
.PP
\fB\-h\fR|\-\-help
.IP
prints this help
.PP
\fB\-V\fR|\-\-version
.IP
prints version
.PP
\fB\-a\fR|\-\-automatic
.IP
automatic mode
.IP
it is advised to use \fB\-o\fR in conjunction with \fB\-a\fR.
DO NOT use this mode if file has one of the following characteristics:
.IP
\- three channels;
\- bit rate is not 16 or 24 bits per sample.
.PP
\fB\-p\fR|\-\-prepend
.IP
prepends new header to sound file. Input file must be raw (header\-less).
.PP
\fB\-k\fR|\-\-prune
.IP
prune file if terminated by zeros and adjust header.
.PP
\fB\-d\fR|\-\-dry
.IP
corrects header and checks coherence without writing files.
.PP
\fB\-b\fR|\-\-bit\-rate
.IP
bit rate (number of bits per sample, e.g. 16 or 24)
.PP
\fB\-s\fR|\-\-sample\-rate
.IP
sample rate in kHz (number of samples per second, e.g. 44.1 or 96)
.PP
\fB\-c\fR|\-\-channels
.IP
number of channels (1 to 6)
.PP
\fB\-o\fR|\-\-output
.IP
followed by the filename (+path) of output file as argument.
.PP
\fB\-l\fR|\-\-log

Input filename (+path) is an obligatory argument.

Released under GPLv3. This software comes under NO GUARANTEE.
Please backup your files before running this utility.
.PP
This utility will attempt to fix an invalid audio WAVE header.
While it should function correctly for any valid number of channels,
bits per sample, and samples per second, it will only work correctly
on 'normal' WAVE files that contain a single data 'chunk'. Meaning
that if the file has extra subchunks or any junk at the end of the
file, it will create an incorrect WAVE header.
.PP
Two processing modes are available: automatic mode and manual mode
.PP
.B Manual mode
.PP
You must have some knowledge of how the WAVE file was recorded:
.IP
* the number of bits per sample
* the number of samples per second
* the number of channels
.PP
It will allways prompt before making any modifications to your
existing file.
if options \fB\-b\fR, \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-c\fR are not used, a dialog will request values.
.PP
.B Automatic mode
.PP 
fixwav will try to automatically guess how the WAVE file was recorded
and will perform repairs automatically.
.PP
Please do not use in\-place editing mode (see below) as erroneous
guesses could damage your file.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Options which do not take arguments can be combined as in:
.PP
fixwav  oldfile.wav  \fB\-ap\fR \fB\-o\fR newfile.wav
.PP
or, alternatively:
.PP
fixwav \fB\-o\fR newfile.wav \fB\-a\fR \fB\-p\fR oldfile.wav
.PP
Options can be placed in any order.
Legacy syntax is still available and corresponds to in\-place manual mode:
.PP
fixwav oldfile.wav
