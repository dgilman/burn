compilers/architectures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package has been developed with GNU CC in mind. Caution has been
taken to stay compatible with other compilers, but there's been no
testing or whatsoever to ensure anything. 

Most of the code is ISO C99 compliant, with the exception of the
following features not allowed or required in ISO C99:

 *) uint8_t used as bit-field type (see bitfield_t in libvcd/vcd_types.h)
 *) string greater than `4095' chars (see frontends/xml/videocd_dtd.inc)

This package has been tested at least on ppc, alpha and ia32
architectures -- it should work on 64bit big endian as well.  If in
doubt, you can try to run the regression checks with 'make check',
which should at least check for _obvious_ misbehavior...

try avoiding gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0) -- it is known
to slightly miscompile vcdimager.


vcdimager/vcdxbuild
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 *) scantable creation/playing time detection still not accurate enough
 *) mpeg analyzation doesn't detect all non-conforming parameters
 *) memleaks exist
 *) XML strings encodings not handled well yet
