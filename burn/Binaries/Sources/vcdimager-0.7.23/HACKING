CVS
~~~

First of all, you should familiarize yourself with the cvs repository
of this package, since the bugs you want to fix, may have already have
been fixed there...

Write access is only useful, if you plan to become a permanent
contributor, if you only want to submit a few bugfixes diffs are more
adequate. Please contact me, if you want to become a developer for
this project.

CVS Branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~

starting from 0.6.z development has been separated into 'stable' and
'unstable' branches.

Even minor release numbers (x.Y.z, where Y mod 2 == 0) are supposed to
be the stable branches, e.g 0.6.z, 0.8.z, 1.0.z, ...  The (stable)
branch tags are named rel_x_y_branch, with x and y being the major and
minor release numbers respectively.

The latest development/unstable branch is always kept in the 'HEAD'
branch.

Source Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package is more or less separated into a backend library, where
the core work is done, and frontends, which interface to this library.

The backend library is not ready to be distributed separately
_yet_. (API is to be redesigned, memleaks are still featured, error
handling is incomplete, ...)

exists for building vcdimager 0.7.x:

* GNU Automake 1.6.3 or later
* GNU Autoconf 2.53 or later
* GNU help2man 1.25 or later
