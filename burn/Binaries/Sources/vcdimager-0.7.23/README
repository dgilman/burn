*WARNING* this is NOT a stable version *WARNING*

This is GNU VCDImager, the GNU (Super)VideoCD authoring solution for
mastering, extracting and analyzing Video CDs and Super Video CDs.

Refer to the GNU VCDImager manual for more recent information.

For simple PBC-less VCDs the classic 'vcdimager' tool will be enough
(please note, that before 0.7.x the 'vcdimager' tool created a dummy PBC,
while the current 'vcdimager' does not create any PBC at all!),
but if advanced VCD features are needed, like menues, playlists,
additional entry points, auto pause points and so on, the XML based
tools are required to make use of. Examples and more information about
the XML structure in addition to the manual will be added on 
http://www.hvrlab.org/~hvr/vcdimager/

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for general compilation and installation
instructions.

See the file BUGS for known issues.

See the file FAQ for some frequently asked questions (and the
corresponding answers)

The user manual is kept as texinfo documentation. (see
http://www.vcdimager.org/ for ps/pdf/html/dvi/text rendered versions
of the manual)

See http://www.gnu.org/software/vcdimager/ for official informations
about GNU VCDImager.

(until GNU VCDImager becomes ready for production, that is, officially
released, see http://www.vcdimager.org/ for bleeding edge news,
especially for the unstable series)
