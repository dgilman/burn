1 Introduction
**************

Note in the guide, we use the term Video CD to mean some sort of Video
Compact Disk. There are various formats of Video Compact Disks, the
oldest format of which is called "VCD" and is followed by a version
number: 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0. Hopefully it should also be clear by context
whether we are referring to a class of Video Compact Disks or the
specific older format called VCD _version-number_.

   `vcdxrip' can be used to extract or disassemble the contents of a CD
or a on-disk CD (commonly referred to as "ripping").  So in a sense
`vcdxrip' is the inverse of `vcdxbuild'--if you use `vcdxrip' followed
by `vcdxbuild' on the result and then use another `vcdxrip', you should
get exactly what you got the first time you used `vcdxrip' (assuming
everything is working correctly).

   But `vcdxrip' can also disassemble pieces of a CD or CD disk image
and can create an XML Video CD description file without extracting a
single file located on the CD.

   You might use `vcdxrip' as a step in re-mastering or re-authoring
and existing CD, or it could be used to extract MPEGs from a CD or
on-disk CD image file.

   Since Video CD's use the ISO-9660 format, another way to "extract"
an MPEG or piece of a Video CD is simply to mount the CD and use file
copy commands. However this program will interpret the Video-CD
specific files and output a corresponding XML description file.  So
`vcdxrip' is something similar to the program `vcd-info'; however the
latter gives more detailed, lower-level Video-CD specific information
and does not output its results in XML.

2 Command Options
*****************

There are a number of miscellaneous options, but there some broad
categories of options. There is a set of options for specifying what
not to dump, these all start `--no' and another set of options which
specify where the CD-ROM or on-disk CD-ROM image is.

2.1 General Options
===================

Here are some general-purpose options. These you might find on other
programs.

`--help'
     This option give a list of options type `--help'. `-?' is an
     abbreviation however you will probably have to "escape" the
     question mark so that the shell doesn't interpret this; i.e. you
     may have to type `-\?'.

`--usage'
     This option shows an abbreviated usage message

`--verbose'
`-v'
     This option gives more verbose, debugging output.

`--quiet'
`-q'
     Show only critical messages

`--version'
`-V'
     Display version and copyright information and exit after displaying
     this information. Sometimes, you just wanna know what version you
     got.

2.2 Options controlling where to read from
==========================================

If you don't specify any place to read from `vcdxrip' will try to read
from the default device that may be appropriate for your OS.

   There are two broad categories of input, reading from a device that
contains a Compact Disc, and reading from a file on the filesystem that
contains an image that could be burned into a Compact Disk.  The option
for the former category, reading a physical CD, is `--cdrom-device'
(`-C'); options for the latter category, reading a file containing a CD
image, are `--bin-file' (`-b'), `--nrg-file' (`-N'). There is one other
option `--input' (`-i') which blurs the distinction--it tries to figure
out based on the name whether you are reading from a device containing
a CD or not and do the appropriate thing.  Of course, since it only
makes sense to read from one place, these options are mutually
exclusive; use only one option from this set.

* CD-ROM Device::               Reading from a CD-ROM device

2.2.1 Reading from a file containing an on-disk CD image
--------------------------------------------------------

The option `--bin-file' (the short forms for this is `-b') indicate to
read from a file containing an image what might be burned onto Compact
Disk. The format is expected to be in the BIN/CUE format that `cdrdao'
uses and is used by a popular DOS/Windows CD mastering tool.

   If you use the `--toc-file', the file read is expected to be a
`cdrdao' image.

   If you use the `--bin-file' option, the file read is expected to be
the ".BIN" part--this is the bulk of the data.

   If you use the `--nrg-file' option (short form `-N'), the file read
is expected to be a CD-ROM disk image using a proprietary and
unpublished format used by the Nero burning software. Because this is
proprietary and not published, this code has been reverse engineered
and we really can't do as good a job as we can with a cue-sheet file.
It's better not to work with such things when possible.

   If you do not specify a file name after `--bin-file', a default name
is used "videocd.bin" is probably used

2.2.2 Reading from CD-ROM Device
--------------------------------

The option `--cdrom-device' or the short form `-C' is used when you
want to read from a Compact Disk. The name given would be the device
name. If you don't specify a device, a default will be selected based
on the Operating System or information that can be gleaned from the OS.
For example on GNU/Linux, the default device may be `/dev/cdrom', while
on Solaris it might be `/vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0'.


File: vcdxrip.info,  Node: Intelligent Input,  Next: Input options,  Prev: CD-ROM Device,  Up: Where Options

2.2.3 Reading from wherever
---------------------------

The option `--input' or the short form of this `-i' tries to be
intelligent by trying to figure out whether the thing you are referring
to is a device or a CD disc image.

   Currently the algorithm it uses the one that the provided by from the
underlying library: `libcdio'.  It is pretty simple: if the thing
referred to is what in Unix is called a "block" or "character" device
(and there is such a notion in your OS), then it assumes a device name.
When you do "long listing" ("ls -l") of the name and track down
possible symbolic links you will see a "b" or "c" in the first column
if the file is a block or character devices.

   If the thing referred to in an `--input' option is a "regular" file
then it is assumed you have a file image of a CD. If the filename ends
(i.e. the extension is) ".bin" or ".BIN" then we assume a "BIN file" if
the filename ends ".nrg or ".NRG we assume a Nero NRG disk image, and
if the filename ends ".toc" or ".TOC" then we assume a `cdrdao' CD
image.

   Although this algorithm is subject to change and there may be more
sophisticated or alternative methods, in practice I think this does
pretty much what's expected.

   Use at most one option in an invocation from the following list.
These options are described in general in *Note Options controlling
where to read from: Where Options.


File: vcdxrip.info,  Node: Input options,  Prev: Intelligent Input,  Up: Where Options

2.2.4 A list of just input options
----------------------------------

`--bin-file [FILENAME]'
`-b [FILENAME]'
     Specifies a BIN CD-ROM disk image to read from. See *Note Reading
     from a file containing an on-disk CD image: BIN/CUE TOC or NRG
     file.

`--cdrom-device [DEVICE-NAME]'
`-C [DEVICE-NAME]'
     Specifies a CD-ROM device to read from. See *Note Reading from
     CD-ROM Device: CD-ROM Device.

`--nrg-file [FILENAME]'
`-N [FILENAME]'
     Specifies a Nero NRG-format CD-ROM disc image to read from. See
     *Note Reading from a file containing a CD disk image: BIN/CUE TOC
     or NRG file.

`--input [FILE OR DEVICE NAME]'
`-i [FILE OR DEVICE NAME]'
     This option is insensitive to whether the thing reading from is a
     CD-ROM device or a file. See *Note Reading from wherever:
     Intelligent Input.

`--sector-2336'
     This option only makes sense if you are reading from a BIN CD disk
     image This indicates to `vcdxrip' to assume a 2336-byte sector
     mode for image file. _Note: This option is slated to disappear._

`--toc-file [FILENAME]'
`-b [FILENAME]'
     Specifies a cdrdao CD-ROM disc image to read from. See *Note
     Reading from a file containing a CD disc image: BIN/CUE TOC or NRG
     file.

2.3 Options controlling what do you want done
=============================================

By default `vcdxrip' will extract everything it can about a Video CD
image.

   However if you specify something in particular you don't want to
extract, for example you don't want to extract the tracks or "segments"
use  `--nosegments'.

   The options below reduce what is extracted.

   When you use any of the options `--nosequence', `--nosegments',
`--norip' or `--tracks' you will get the warning:

     Some entry point and auto pause locations might not be checked.

   Without looking into the MPEG's we don't know how big they are and
therefore can't verify if entry points and auto pause lie inside the
MPEGs.

`--nofiles'
     Video CD's are formatted on an ISO-9660 filesystem. As such they
     may have additional files that are not strictly necessary for
     Video CD operation. For example, there may be some additional
     documentation or commentary in some sort of text format and these
     may be put under additional directories.  Normally, such files are
     extracted with the directory or path information removed. If you
     don't want these additional files extracted use the `--nofiles'
     option.

     Using `--nofiles' will still extract files which are necessary for
     Video CD playback however. (These are located under the /SEGMENT,
     /EXT, /CDDDA, /SVCD, and/or /VCD directories).  The options below
     however may affect Video CD operation and they are mutually
     exclusive of this operation. That is, this operation does not
     touch any of the files that the options below will and vice versa.

`--nosegments'
     Segment play items are usually stored one per "track" in the CD,
     are an MPEG of some sort.  They often constitute the bulk of the
     CD, and when extracted by this program will start have a name of
     the form `avseq_dd_.mpg' where _dd_ is a two-digit number.

     Segment items are located in under the /SEGMENT directory on the
     CD. However when extracted these directories do not appear.

     If you don't want to extract these MPEG files, use this option. To
     extract only a specific track see the `--track' option below.

     If you use the option `--nosegments', you might not be able create
     a CD image back unless some of these files are created or the XML
     description modified.  Another way to "extract" these file might
     be to "mount" the CD and use your OS's file copy commands.

`--nosequences'
     Sequence items are usually smaller than segment item and can be
     stored with more than on item per track. They often constitute for
     menus or still frame selections. When extracted by this program
     will start have a name of the form `item_dddd_.mpg' where _dddd_
     is a four-digit number.

     Sequence items are located in under the /MPEGAV, /MPEG2
     directories.  However when extracted these directories do not
     appear.

     If you don't want to extract these MPEG files, use this option. You
     may however might not be able create a CD image back unless some of
     these files are created or the XML description modified.  Another
     way to "extract" these file might be to "mount" the CD and use your
     OS's file copy commands.

`--norip'
     Just create an XML description file of the format used by
     `vcdxbuild'. Using this option is like adding the options
     `--nofiles', `--nosequences', `--nosegments'.

`--track TRACK-NUM'
     If you want to extract only a single track (segment) from a CD
     rather than all of them, use this option. This option does not
     make sense and has no effect if you have also given the option
     `--nosegments'.

=========================

`--progress'
`-p'
     Show progress.

`--output-file'
`-o'
     Specify the place to write the output XML description file. The

3.1 Examples specifying input
=============================

Perhaps all you want to do is rip a CD onto your disk to modify it.  If
the CD is in the default location for your OS, then this might work:


     vcdxrip

   It means the same thing as:


     vcdxrip --cdrom-device

   and using the short option:


     vcdxrip -C

   I have a combined CD-ROM and DVD drive called `/dev/dvd'. I have
another CD-ROM drive which goes under the name `/dev/cdrom', but I
generally prefer to use the DVD/CD-ROM drive for reading since it
doesn't seem to run as hot. Since that drive is not the "default"
(`/dev/cdrom') on my GNU/Linux box, I have to give a location. So this
will work:


     vcdxrip -C=/dev/dvd

   Or even better, I'll let `vcdxrip' figure out it's a CD-ROM device:


     vcdxrip -i /dev/dvd

   The equals sign before `/dev/dvd' is optional in either format.

   Let's say you just used `vcdimager' or `vcdxbuild' it created output
to its "default" location (probably `videocd.cue' and `videocd.bin'. To
dump out this out:


     vcdxrip --bin-file

   But if you specified the output to go to say `nausicaa.bin' and
`nausicaa.cue' you would have to specify that location like this:


     vcdxrip -b nausicaa.bin

   Or again not having to worry about what type of file you could use
the "intelligent" input option again as we did before:


     vcdxrip -i nausicaa.bin

   If I want the XML file that gets created to to "nausicaa.xml" rather
than "videocd.xml" then use this:


     vcdxrip -i nausicaa.bin -o nausicaa.xml


File: vcdxrip.info,  Node: Extraction Examples,  Prev: Input Examples,  Up: Some Examples

3.2 Examples specifying what to rip
===================================

If I just want the XML description only for the last example in the
previous section:


     vcdxrip --norip -i nausicaa.bin --output-file nausicaa.xml

   Suppose I want extract only the big MPEGs of the CD in the default CD
without menus and extra file information. This is probably close:


     vcdxrip --nosequences --nofiles

   The above will create an XML description file. Suppose on the other
hand I just want the extraneous files but not the MPEG data of the CD
in the default CD-ROM drive, then this may work:


     vcdxrip --noseqeunces --nosegments

   If you only want to extract track 1 from your CD this might work:


     vcdxrip --track 1
