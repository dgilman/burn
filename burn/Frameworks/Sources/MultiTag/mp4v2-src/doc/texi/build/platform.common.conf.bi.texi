@subsection Bi-arch compilation
The preferred method to produce a bi-arch binary is to specify the target (eg. 32-bit) with the following option to configure. This example will produce a 32-bit binary if compiling on a platform which defaults to producing 64-bit binaries. The inverse is also possible.

@example
../configure --enable-bi=32
@end example

@quotation Warning
Currently bi-arch cross-compilation is not supported due to a bug with libtool which fails miserably during linking.
