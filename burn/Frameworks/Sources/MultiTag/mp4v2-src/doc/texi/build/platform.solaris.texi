@section @value{OS.solaris}
Building on @value{OS.solaris} is supported. The following are the recommended specifications for this platform; but is not necessarily the only configuration that is possible:

@itemize @bullet
@item Intel 32-bit or 64-bit hardware
@item @value{OS.solaris} 10u6, gcc 3.4.3
@item gcc 3.4.0 or higher is reported to work
@end itemize

@include build/platform.common.bundled.texi
@quotation Note
@value{OS.solaris} does not (yet) really bundle a compiler. The recommendation is to use the companion-disk compiler for maximum C++ runtime compatibility. It is usually found in @file{/usr/sfw/bin}.
